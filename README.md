# Short Programming Project: Visualize collaboration among developers worldwide

This project aims to visualize collaboration between developers worldwide, by creating a graphical representation that shows how 
programmers from different locations can collaborate on group projects. The main focus of this application is to provide a visual representation of the 
location of the collaborators of your projects. Also, it provides the time difference between your current location and the location of each collaborator.
